Here is a joke generated using the `pyjokes` library:

```python
import pyjokes
joke = pyjokes.get_joke()
print(joke)
```

When you run the above code, it will print a randomly selected joke from the `pyjokes` library. The contents of the joke will be a string that represents a short, humorous statement typically related to programming or technology.

For example:
```
Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don't C#.
```

The exact joke may vary each time you run the code since `pyjokes.get_joke()` returns a random joke from its collection.
